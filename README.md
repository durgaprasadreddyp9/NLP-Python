# NLP-Python
This project aims to develop an Automatic Text Summarization System using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and Scikit-learn. The system processes news headlines to extract and summarize the most important sentences using the TextRank algorithm.

conclusion: spaCy is the preferred tool for text summarization due to its extensive NLP capabilities, efficient processing, and robust ecosystem. It excels in handling more intricate text analysis tasks, rendering it a versatile and potent solution for producing precise and insightful summaries.
